 A dictionary is a very important tool for anyone who is learning a new language.
 With the dictionary I had created , you can do the following: 
1-look up the meaning of an English word you see or hear. 
2-find the English translation of a word in your language.
The dictionary had seen all the aspects and possibilities that the user is capable of inputing the text.
The dictionary i had created is using python language,which is also used for several purposes.
I had used The Json open standard file format-
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans 
to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
I had used the difflib module which is a very essential and important module in my miniproject
i.e:V-Dictionary !!
